## Hey, I'm John ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer passionate about building state-of-the-art software products that are also user-accessible. To give a bit of background on myself, I completed my Bachelors of Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I majored in biology and minored in computer science and chemistry. I will be starting a Masters of Science in Computer Science starting Fall of 2023! 
<br>
I am especially excited about web development and machine learning!
